# Visulaing Climate Change - Data Wrangling and Data Visualization

A Modified Github Repo from my senior-design group, "*Data Visualization*". We were a groupfour computer science undergraduates studying at UCSC. However, this repo features almost exclusively my work accomplished with the team as well as new code I have developed since graduating.

Directory breakdown
* dataSets  
	- Contains all Datasets and corresponding data parsing code. All the python parsing code is mine
* src       
	- Website, click heroku link (My personal heroku) or run locally to view
	- Heavily modified to show what I specifically worked on. Other people's visualizations/HTML sections have been removed
	- CSS Files were not touched, so there are some legacy variables left from other members code
	- I did the back-end HTML management of the project so what you see is either mine or template code I borrowed
	- I used HTML frameworks to setup the website and have given appropriate credit on each webpage. Nonetheless, here is another link to the provider: https://colorlib.com/
