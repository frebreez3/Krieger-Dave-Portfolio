# Dave-Krieger: Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I have provided three different programs showcasing my experience and skills. My most recent and best work is likely my senior-design-project: "visualizing-climate-change. My team and I spent two quarters developing a climate change website featuring unique data-visualizations. Since graduating, I have stripped all their work out and have continued work on my own repo of this project.  

* Visualizing Climate Change
	* Data Wrangling via Python
	* Data Visualization via D3 (.js library, but pretty much a language of its own)
	* Web Development via HTML/CSS/JS
	* We used the agile/scrum methodology throughout development
		* Email me if you would like to view our scrum documentation
		
* loop-it-in-xilinx
	* Showcases micro-processor interaction with user input as well as external VGA TV interaction.
	* It is a uses schematics, state-machine logic, and verilog.
	* Screenshots have been provided of the schematics as well as of my notebook
	* Lab report is included to help understand the assignment
	
* http-ftp-in-c
 	* Showcases low C programming to create a client-server FTP system.
	* Reads http-protocol headers and parses them
	* Users can register, login, and GET/POST only their specific files.
