Features the use of UART communication in five different parts

* Part 1 requires students to transmit and receive data based on polling.
* Part 2 requires students to produce the same output but instead use interrupts.
* Part 3 yet again reuses some of the code from part 1 and 2 but now students must toggle hardware control to manage data transfer.
* Part 4 uses two PsoC-5 boards and requires students to not only track errors in data transfer, but also display the transfer rate. Furthermore, the system requires a sync method which allows the user to unplug and replug the wires and continue successful data transfer.
* Part 5 uses two PsoC-5 and has students vary the clock frequency. The goal of part 5 is to develop enough data to determine the range of frequencies that is acceptable for the UART to successfully transmit and receive data.
